app.py: Main application file that initializes the app and 
registers routes.

config.py: Stores configuration settings, which makes it easy 
to manage and change credentials or API keys without affecting 
the main logic.

database.py: Encapsulates database access logic, making it easier 
to manage database interactions and ensure connections are 
properly opened and closed.

routes/: Organizes different endpoints logically, allowing for 
easier navigation and modification of routes.

utils/: Contains utility functions that are reused across the 
application, reducing code duplication.

templates/ and static/: Keep the HTML, CSS, and JS separate 
from Python code, following best practices for web development.
